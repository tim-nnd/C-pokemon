# C-pokemon
A little project I made during the first semester, inspired by pokemon games.

This game is created with the C language and runs in the command prompt.
it still has a few bugs my past self couldn't fix.

The game has a save and load system which keeps track of the player's progress. 
Player's progress are saved as a '.txt' file named after the player's username.

The game reads a 'map.txt' file which can be changed and the game will behave accordingly.

Controls are keyboard-based.
